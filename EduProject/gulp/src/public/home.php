                <h1>What is this?</h1>
                <p>This is a mobile-optimised progressive web application to teach first-year University students, or
                    even
                    those who know nothing about Computer Science, the fundamentals of Web Development and Java
                    Programming.
                    This is not intended to replace
                    proper teaching modules at high-level educational institutions nor cover as much as one, but this is
                    rather an introductory web application to teach the core aspects in fun, engaging ways which you can
                    take into the proper modules
                    as a head start!</p>
                <p>The Web Development module will cover a variety of current web technologies, providing you a strong
                    knowledge foundation to create simple standards-compliant web pages. The objective is to learn about
                    the vitals of developing stuff for the Web, and dive into the
                    intricacies
                    HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!</p>
                <p>The Java Programming module will establish essential concepts and skills required to create simple
                    programs in the Java programming language. Learn the fundamentals of programming through Java, and
                    become
                    knowledgeable on variables, loops,
                    methods, and more!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="intro-column">
                <h1>The ultimate test!</h1>
                <p>The quizzes you will encounter will evaluate your knowledge of the entirety of the modules you
                    partake in! For Web Development, this will be comprised of HTML,
                    CSS, and JavaScript questions relating to the material we've covered in them! For Java Programming,
                    this will be about learning how to write code and create programmes, and skills will be taught that
                    are transferrable to other programming languages!</p>
                <p>The quizzes are composed of twenty-five random multiple-choice questions, and are great tools
                    for checking your understanding of the aforementioned topics as quizzes are accessible and enjoyable
                    to
                    partake in! The answer is in front of you â€“ you just have to figure out which one to choose!</p>
